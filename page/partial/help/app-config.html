	<h5>App Config JSON</h5>
	<div>
		<p>NoSQL:IDE is fully driven by JSON doc files. The main JSON doc is <strong>app.config.json</strong>. This JSON
			doc stores all the necessary information for configuring, loading, running and connecting to your databases.
			To edit your app.config.json, click the config settings <span class="bold underline">Gears</span> icon in
			top/left of app UI.
		</p>
		<p>
			Following is an example of a valid app.config.json that can connect to 2 different <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firestore</a> databases. You
			can connect to any number of different databases.
		</p>
		<p>
			Details for each attrib are below the screenshot.

			main left nav bar.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h5>schemaNamespaceUrl</h5>
			This sets the default namespace for your document schemas. All <a class="text-secondary"
				href="https://json-schema.org">json-schema.org</a> schemas need a unique namespace.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h5>db</h5>
			This object stores the database specific info for each of your different databases.
			<div style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px;">
				<p>
					<h5>db.<span class="db-name">yourdatabasename</span></h5>
					Enter one of these objects within the db object for each of your different database. Ofc replace
					<i>yourdatabasename</i> text with the actual name of your database.
				</p>
				<div style="margin-left: 20px; padding-left: 20px;">
					<p>
						<h5>db.<span class="db-name">yourdatabasename</span>.toolsPlugin</h5>
						This sets the correct DbTools plugin to load for your specific database. As of 7/20/19: Only
						Google
						Firestore database is supported. More DbTools plugins are in development.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>db.<span class="db-name">yourdatabasename</span>.dbUserEmail</h5>
						This sets the user account credentials name/email used to connect to your database. This account
						must have an appropriate role in your database with enough permissions to read/write to your
						collections. It does not have to be a full admin account.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>db.<span class="db-name">yourdatabasename</span>.dbUserPass</h5>
						This sets the user account credentials password. NOTE: <i>Nothing</i> in this app.config.json is
						transmitted out or copied/stored anywhere outside your local computer. Your account creditials
						are local and safe.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>db.<span class="db-name">yourdatabasename</span>.softDeleteAttrib</h5>
						This sets the name of the collection attribute used to mark your documents as <i>soft
							deleted</i>.
						Set this to null if you do not want to use soft deleted documents. NoSQL:IDE queries
						<i>automatically honor</i> this soft delete attrib. You <i>do need</i> to have/set this attrib
						to false when creating new docs, however there is no need to enter it in any queries. Soft
						deleting is better than hard deletes for soooo many reasons. NOTE: A new cleanup feature to
						purge (hard delete) ranges of soft deleted documents is in development.
					</p>
					<p>
						<h5>db.<span class="db-name">yourdatabasename</span>.config</h5>
						This is your database configuration details. You must get this specific JSON from your database
						provider. The screen cap above shows a Google <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firestore</a> config. Please consult the documentation

						<h5>db.<span class="db-name">yourdatabasename</span>.collections</h5>
						These are the names of each collections in your database you wish to access. Leave out any
						collection you don't want/need to edit.
